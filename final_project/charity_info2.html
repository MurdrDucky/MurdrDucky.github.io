   <h1>The Trevor Project</h1>
    <p>
        Our long-term vision is to build a world where we are no
        longer needed — where every LGBTQ+ young person is
        loved and accepted for who they are, and therefore not
        at higher risk for suicide or mental health crisis.
        Until then, we’ll continue to meet the need sustainably
        and refine our efforts intentionally so that we can provide support to every LGBTQ+ young person who needs it. <a href="products.html" class="linkc"> Visit Products</a>
